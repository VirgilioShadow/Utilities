`git squash` is not a standalone Git command, but the term "squash" is commonly used in the context of combining multiple commits into a single commit. This can be done during an interactive rebase. Squashing commits can help create a cleaner, more readable commit history. Hereâ€™s how it works:

### Using Interactive Rebase to Squash Commits

1. **Switch to the branch you want to clean up:**

   ```sh
   git checkout your-branch
   ```

2. **Start an interactive rebase:**

   ```sh
   git rebase -i HEAD~n
   ```

   - Replace `n` with the number of commits you want to combine. For example, if you want to squash the last 3 commits, use `HEAD~3`.

3. **Modify the rebase instructions:**

   - An editor will open with a list of commits. It will look something like this:
     ```
     pick 1234567 Commit message 1
     pick 89abcdef Commit message 2
     pick fedcba98 Commit message 3
     ```

4. **Change `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for the commits you want to squash:**

   - The commit to be kept should be left as `pick`. Change the others to `squash`:
     ```
     pick 1234567 Commit message 1
     squash 89abcdef Commit message 2
     squash fedcba98 Commit message 3
     ```

5. **Save and close the editor:**

   - A new editor window will open, allowing you to edit the commit message for the combined commit. You can adjust it as needed.

6. **Complete the rebase:**

   - Save and close the editor to finish the rebase process.

7. **Force-push the changes (if the branch is shared, be cautious with force-pushing):**
   ```sh
   git push --force
   ```

### Example

Consider you have the following commits:

```
commit 1234567 - Add initial feature
commit 89abcdef - Fix typo
commit fedcba98 - Improve feature
```

You want to squash the last two commits into the first one. The interactive rebase instruction file would look like this after your changes:

```
pick 1234567 Add initial feature
squash 89abcdef Fix typo
squash fedcba98 Improve feature
```

After saving and closing the editor, you'll be prompted to edit the commit message for the squashed commit.

### Result

After squashing, the commit history will have a single commit combining the changes of all squashed commits:

```
commit abcdef12 - Add initial feature with fixes and improvements
```

### Summary

Squashing commits helps streamline your commit history by combining multiple small commits into a single, more meaningful commit. This is particularly useful for cleaning up a feature branch before merging it into the main branch.
